⚠️ Note for Reviewers:


In case you are unable to open or run the project, I have included several screenshots below to demonstrate the main features of PhishGuard Assistant.Just open the README.md file to see the screenshots you can use github or just go in README.md file and type----Ctrl+Shift+V.

However, for a full and interactive experience, I highly recommend following the setup guide to run the project locally. This will allow you to see the chat assistant, phishing quiz, link analyzer, and dashboard in action.
